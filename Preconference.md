There will be a Computational preconference at this year's <a href = "https://www.socialaffectiveneuro.org/conferences.html">SANS</a> meeting in Miami, FL.

The goal of this workshop is to provide a general introduction to applying computational approaches to social and affective neuroscience questions. Each speaker will provide an introduction to a specific technique (e.g., drift diffusion modeling, multivariate prediction and representational similarity analysis, functional alignment, and social networks) and illustrate how these techniques can be can be used to make inferences about various computational and affective processes. In addition we will have group discussions about "Barriers to Training" and "What is a Model?"
